Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Projects

The Udacity course python notebooks were exported to HTML and then converted to PDF after running.
The notebooks contained stubbed functions to implement (see TODO sections). The projects included: (1) A simple neural network
for predicting a time series (2) A convolutional neural network for image classification (3) Text generation (TV scripts) 
using RNNs (4) Seq2seq model for language translation and (4) GANs for synthetic face generation.
